## Title of the slide

This is just some really boring text whose only goal is to check what it would mean to write some text here.

In fact, my aim here is more to show you what a typical slide would look like.

Does it look sleek? Does it seem correct? "Les français ont le droit de savoir!"

```python
def main(arg):
  print('Test')
```

```cypher
MATCH (n:Book) WHERE n.title = 'Test' RETURN n LIMIT 10;
```
